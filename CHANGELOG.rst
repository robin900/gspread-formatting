  A certain set of functions that exist both in batch and standalone mode
  are dynamically bound as local names in the functions subpackage. That makes
  them undiscoverable by IDEs like PyCharm. Adding a straightforward import
  statement for these function names -- even though the names are re-bound
  immediately with wrapped standalone versions of the functions -- makes
  the function names visible to PyCharm.

  stumbles on Pandas install problems; my local PyPy3 environment (which
  required special NumPy source install with OpenBLAS config) shows a
  successful test suite. [Robin Thomas]
- Remove pypy3 travis target until pandas install problems can be fixed.
